My Lord Bag of Rice

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Long, long ago there lived in Japan

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
a brave warrior known to all as Tawara Toda

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
or “My Lord Bag of Rice”.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
His true name was Fujiwara Hidesato

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and there is a very interesting story

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of how he came to change his name.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
One day he went out in search of adventures

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because he had the nature of a warrior

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and could not bear to be idle.

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So he picked up his two swords,

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
took his huge bow,

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which was much taller than himself, in his hand,

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
strapped his quiver on his back and started out.
