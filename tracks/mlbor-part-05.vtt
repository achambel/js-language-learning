00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.000
I have lived for many years in this
lake and I have a large family of
children and grand-children.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.500
For some time, we have lived in terror
because a monster centipede has
discovered our home, and night
after night it comes and carries off
one of my family.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I am powerless to save them. If it
goes on much longer like this, I will
not only lose all my children, but I
myself will become a victim of the monster.

4
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.000
I am, therefore, very unhappy, and in my desperation I
determined to ask the help of a human being.

5
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:47.000
For many days with this intention
I have waited on the bridge in the shape
of the horrible serpent-dragon that you saw, in
the hope that some strong brave man would come along.

6
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But all who came this way, as soon
as they saw me, were terrified and
ran away as fast as they could.

7
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.000
You are the first man I have found able
to look at me without fear, so I knew at once that you were a man
of great courage.

8
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.000
I beg you to have pity on me. Will you not help me
and kill my enemy the centipede?
