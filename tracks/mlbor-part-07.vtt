Never had Hidesato seen anything
so beautiful as this palace built of
white marble beneath the lake.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
He had often heard of the Sea Kingâ€™s
palace at the bottom of the sea,
where all the servants and
retainers were salt-water fishes,
but here was a magnificent
building in the heart of Lake Biwa.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The dainty goldfishes, red carp,
and silvery trout, waited upon the
Dragon King and his guest.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Hidesato was astonished at the
feast that was spread for him. The
dishes were crystallized lotus
leaves and flowers, and the
chopsticks were of the rarest ebony.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.000
As soon as they sat down, the
sliding doors opened and ten lovely
goldfish dancers came out, and
behind them followed ten red-carp
musicians with the koto and the
samisen.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Thus the hours flew by
until midnight, and the beautiful
music and dancing had banished all
thoughts of the centipede.
