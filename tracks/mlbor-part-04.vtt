Where had the dragon gone in such
a short space of time? Or had it
transformed itself into this man?
And what did the whole thing mean?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.500
While these thoughts
passed through his mind, he had
come up to the man on the bridge
and addressed him:

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.000
"Was it you that called me just
now? " "Yes, it was I," answered the
man. "I have an important request
to make to you. Do you think you
can grant it to me?"

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
"If it is in my power to do so, I will," answered Hidesato,
"but first tell me who you are."

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
"I am the Dragon King of the Lake,
and my home is in these waters just under this bridge."

6
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
"And what is it you have to ask of me?" said Hidesato.

7
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:57.000
"I want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede, who lives on the
mountain beyond," and the Dragon King pointed to a high peak on the
opposite shore of the lake.
