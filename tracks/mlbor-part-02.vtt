He had not gone far when he came
to the bridge of Seta-no-Karashi
crossing one end of the beautiful
Lake Biwa.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
As soon as he stepped on the
bridge, he saw lying right across his
path a huge serpent-dragon.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Its body was so big that it looked like
the trunk of a large pine tree and it
took up the whole width of the bridge.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
One of its huge claws rested on the
parapet of one side of the bridge
while its tail lay right against the other.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The monster seemed to be
asleep, and as it breathed, fire and
smoke came out of its nostrils.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:49.000
At first, Hidesato could not help
feeling alarmed at the sight of this
horrible reptile lying in his path,
for he must either turn back or
walk right over its body.
